Description:
    The rjdverse libraries are the officially recommended R software for seasonal adjustment in the European Central Bank and Statistical System.
	The RJDProcessor library integrates the rjdverse packages into a fully R-based production pipeline, ready to be used and easily extendable by methodologists.
	It offers the capability to manage the entire seasonal adjustment process: acquisition, processing, storage, automation, and not just seasonal adjustment of the data.
	Processing of multiple time series is possible by storing their specifications in JSON files, and interoperability with other JDemetra+ software is guaranteed because RJDProcessor can read workspaces and is able to produce them as an output.
