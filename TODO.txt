- Fixed Coefficients for Intervention Variables (now ypu need to transform them into UsrDefined variablesâ€¦)
  
- Fixed Coefficients for JD+'s automatic TD and Leap Year should be tested and eventually added. Should Leap year be treated as Easter with its coef? 
    Do I need to order the td variables and leap year (lp) to be at the end of the array of coefficients like td from external file? (remember that if 
    td are generated utomatically, external td ["td|..."] are not present). See reorder_ext_vars_td_at_the_end(strings) function in 
    utility_functions.R 

NOTE: Ramps, UserDefinedVariables, Easter and Outliers fixed coefficents are ok
