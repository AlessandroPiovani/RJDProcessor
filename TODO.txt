- Fixed Coefficients for Intervention Variables (now you need to transform them into UsrDefined variablesâ€¦)
	To see how to format the variable name for the variable whose coefficent has to be fixed, see the FixedCoefficient panel on the GUI
  
- Fixed Coefficients for JD+'s automatic TD and Leap Year should be tested and eventually added. Same for ARIMA_mean (it must also have a type slot: "Fixed" or "Initial" or "Undefined", "NA" by default). I think that ARIMA_mean, Leap Year and automatic TD must have dedicated slots for their fixed coefficents (leapYearCoef and automaticTdCoef) in JSON 
    
NOTE: Ramps, UserDefinedVariables, Easter and Outliers fixed coefficents are ok
