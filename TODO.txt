- Fixed Coefficients for Intervention Variables (now you need to transform them into UsrDefined variablesâ€¦)
  
- Fixed Coefficients for JD+'s automatic TD and Leap Year should be tested and eventually added. I think that Leap Year and automatic TD most have dedicated slots for their coefficents (leapYearCoef and automaticTdCoef)  
    
NOTE: Ramps, UserDefinedVariables, Easter and Outliers fixed coefficents are ok
